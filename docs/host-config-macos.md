## Automatic installation using `install.py`

The `install.py` script will attempt to guide you through the installation of Docker and Docker Compose if they are not present, similar to how it's illustrated in the [**Installation example using Ubuntu 24.04 LTS**](ubuntu-install-example.md#InstallationExample). If that works, skip ahead to **Configure docker daemon option** in this section.

## Install Homebrew

The easiest way to install and maintain docker on Mac is using the [Homebrew cask](https://brew.sh). Execute the following in a terminal.

```
$ /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
$ brew install cask
```

## Install Docker Desktop and Docker Compose

```
$ brew install --cask docker-desktop
```
This will install the latest version of `docker`. It can be upgraded later using `brew` as well:
```
$ brew upgrade --cask --no-quarantine docker
```
You can now run Docker from the Applications folder. Docker Desktop on macOS also includes the Docker Compose plugin.

## Configure docker daemon option

Some changes should be made for performance. See the following (unaffiliated) posts/articles for more information:

* **Resource allocation** - For best results, Mac users should be running recent system with at least 32GB RAM and an SSD. In the system tray, select **Docker** ‚Üí **Preferences** ‚Üí **Advanced**. Set the resources available to Docker to at least 6 CPUs and at least 24GB RAM (even more is preferable).

* **Volume mount performance** - Users can speed up performance of volume mounts by removing unused paths from **Docker** ‚Üí **Preferences** ‚Üí **File Sharing**. For example, if volumes are mounted under the home directory only, users could share /Users but remove other paths.

After making these changes, right-click on the Docker üêã icon in the system tray and select **Restart**.
